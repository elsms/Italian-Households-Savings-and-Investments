# Introduction 
This project, completed for the [Economics of Risk and Agent Behavior](https://www.unive.it/data/course/506445) module at [Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/web/en/497/home), explores how demographic and economic factors influenced Italian households' saving and investment decisions in 2022.

Recalling Modigliani’s **Life-Cycle Hypothesis**, which suggests individuals smooth consumption over their lifetime, the analysis uses empirical data to show that age, income, and household composition strongly affect saving and investment behavior.

The findings highlight that real-world financial decisions are shaped by multiple factors beyond the simple lifetime optimization proposed by the model.

# Data 
The analysis uses the [**2022 Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW)**](https://www.bancaditalia.it/statistiche/tematiche/indagini-famiglie-imprese/bilanci-famiglie/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1&dotcache=refresh) conducted by the Bank of Italy.

The dataset provides detailed information on Italian households' income and savings. The analysis focuses on: 
* household structure and household members' characteristics
* work and income
* saving and investment decisions

The data used is available in this [folder](Data).
