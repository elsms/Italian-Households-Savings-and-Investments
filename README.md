This project, carried out for the course [Economics of Risk and Agent Behavior](https://www.unive.it/data/course/506445) at [Ca' Foscari University of Venice](https://www.unive.it/web/en/497/home), investigates how demographic and economic factors influenced Italian households' saving and investment decisions in 2022.

It examines Modigliani’s Life-Cycle Hypothesis, which predicts that individuals smooth consumption over their lifetime. Using empirical data, the analysis shows that demographic and economic factors such as age, income, and household composition significantly influence saving and investment decisions. These findings indicate that real-world behavior is shaped by multiple factors beyond the simple lifetime optimization proposed by the model.

# Data 
For this analysis, we used the **2022 Survey on Household Income and Wealth (SHIW)** conducted by the Bank of Italy. The dataset is publicly available [here](https://www.bancaditalia.it/statistiche/tematiche/indagini-famiglie-imprese/bilanci-famiglie/index.html?com.dotmarketing.htmlpage.language=1&dotcache=refresh).

The SHIW collects detailed information on the income and savings of Italian households. This analysis focused on: 
* household structure and household members' characteristics
* work and income
* saving and investment decisions
